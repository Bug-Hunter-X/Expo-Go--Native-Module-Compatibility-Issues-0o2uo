To resolve this, ensure that all native modules used by your libraries are compatible with Expo Go.  If the library doesn't support Expo Go directly, consider alternatives, use EAS Build for building your app (instead of Expo Go), or potentially building a custom native module wrapper. Here is an example of how to include a module using EAS Build:  

```javascript
// This example isn't for resolving the native modules problem directly. This is for using EAS Build.

import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

For EAS build setup, refer to the Expo documentation for native modules and EAS Build.
